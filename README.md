# Senscience Nexus

Originally created and maintained byt the Blue Brain Project, Senscience Nexus is an ecosystem that allows you to organize and better leverage your data through the use of a Knowledge Graph. In addition to the products listed here, you’ll find a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.

## Products

The Senscience Nexus ecosystem encompasses a broad range of capabilities that are brought to you across three complementary products and a suite of utilities.

### Nexus Fusion

*Enabling Collaborative Data and Knowledge Discovery*

Fusion is our extensible web application. It hosts different apps to accommodate various use cases. It comes by default with Studios (where you work with data), Admin (for managing the Nexus instance), and will soon support Workflows to organise your data activities. It runs on top of the Delta web services, and integrates neatly with our Forge python framework.

### Nexus Forge

*Building and Using Knowledge Graphs Made Easy*

Nexus Forge is a domain-agnostic, generic and extensible Python framework enabling non-expert users to create and manage knowledge graphs.

### Nexus Delta

*Managing the Data and Knowledge Graph Lifecycle*

A scalable and secure service to store and leverage all your data, neatly organised in a Knowledge Graph. It offers an API to perform all your data management operations, this way it can easily integrate with your software stack. Its advanced indexing capabilities automatically build views from your metadata.
